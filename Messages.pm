=head1 NAME

Text::Messages - create objects with methods you can call to generate both
                 static and dynamic status, error, or other messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # create a list of messages
    $error_messages = Messages->new({
      bad_file_format  => 'File format not recognized!',
      file_open_failed => sub{"Unable to open file $_[0]: $!"},
      _default         => sub{"Unknown message " . shift() . 
                              " with params " . (join ",",@_)},
    });

  # generate messages
    print $error_messages->bad_file_format;           
    print $error_messages->file_open_failed('myfile');
    print $error_messages->no_such_message;  # falls back to _default

  # override default prefixes and suffixes
    $error_messages->set_prefix("myprogram: ");
    $error_messages->set_suffix("\n");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Overview

With the Text::Messages class, you can create objects that dynamically
construct status, error, or other messages on behalf of your programs.
Text::Messages is particularly useful in larger projects, where it can be
used to create centralized collections of messages that are easier to
maintain and document than string literals scattered throughout the code.

To create a Text::Messages object, you'll need to create a hash containing 
a set of keywords and a message associated with each keyword, then pass that
hash to the C<new> constructor. The keywords you choose are then exposed as 
methods of an individual Text::Messages object, so you can generate messages
with this syntax:

  $messages->message_keyword(...with params too, if you want...)

The messages themselves may be either literal strings or anonymous subroutines
that can perform arbitrarily complex operations. For instance, if you create
an C<$error_messages> object like this:

  $error_messages = Text::Messages->new({
    file_open_failed => sub{"Unable to open file $_[0]: $!\n"}
  });

You can then write this:

  open INPUT, "/no/such/file" 
    or die $error_messages->file_open_failed('myfile');

And get this result:

  Unable to open file myfile: No such file or directory

Notice that parameters to the method call are accessible to your subroutine
via C<@_>, and that the global C<$!> variable containing the error message
from the last file operation is available too.

When you're using static error messages -- i.e., where interpolation at the
moment of message generation is not required -- you can skip the anonymous
subroutine and simply provide a string literal:

  $status_messages = Text::Messages->new(
    new_record => 'loading new record',
    all_done   => 'processing complete',
  );
  ...
  print $status_messages->new_record;
  ...
  print $status_messages->all_done;

=head2 Prefixes and Suffixes

Whether you're using static or dynamic messages, there's actually one more
thing that Text::Messages objects do when constructing messages: They add a
prefix and a suffix. By default, the prefix contains the name of the current
executable (stripped of path information if you're running on a Windows or 
Unix variant), and the suffix is simply a newline. So in practice you'll
normally get messages that look more like this:

  YourProgramName: Unable to open file myfile: No such file or directory\n

You can change this behavior by calling the C<set_prefix> and C<set_suffix>
methods:

  $error_messages->set_prefix("Error: ");
  $error_messages->set_suffix(".");

which would result instead in:

  Error: Unable to open file myfile: No such file or directory.

The prefix and suffix that you set apply to all messages emitted by an
individual Text::Messages object.

(Incidentally, you can retrieve the current prefix and suffix by using the 
C<get_prefix> and C<get_suffix> methods, but I can't think of a particularly
compelling reason to actually do that.)

=head2 Defining Fallback Messages

What happens if you try to call a method for which no message was defined?
Text::Messages provides default behavior, so that:

  print $status_messages->no_such_message('nice try', 'dude');

results in:

  YourProgramName: message no_such_message(nice try,dude)\n

You can override this behavior by specifying a C<_default> key (and
associated message) in your constructor:

  $error_messages = Text::Messages->new({
    bad_file_format => 'File format not recognized!',
    _default => sub{"Unknown message '$_[0]' received"},
  });

With this C<_default> definition, the output would instead be:

  YourProgramName: Unknown message 'no_such_message' received\n

=head2 Practical Uses

If you have a fairly large, multi-module program, you may want to centralize
many of your messages in a single module somewhere. For example:

  package MyMessages;
  @ISA = qw(Exporter);
  @EXPORT = qw($error_messages $status_messages);
  use vars qw($error_messages $status_messages);
  use Text::Messages;
  use strict;
  
  {
    my $verbose = 1;

    $error_messages = Text::Messages->new(
      file_open => sub {return qq{file open failed on $_[0]: $!}},
      _default  => sub {return "unknown error $_[0] reported"},
    );

    $status_messages = Text::Messages->new(
      starting_parser    => ($verbose ? "Starting parser\n" : ""),
      starting_generator => ($verbose ? sub {"Starting generator $_[0]\n"} : ""),
    );
    $status_messages->set_prefix();
    $status_messages->set_suffix();

    1;
  }

Then your other modules can simply C<use MyMessages> and do things like:

  print $status_messages->starting_parser;
  print $status_messages->starting_generator('alpha');
  print $status_messages->starting_generator('omega');
  print $error_messages->unexpected_end_of_file;

Since all your messages are located in one module, it's a simple task to
change their wording, control their level of verbosity with a single
statement, and so on. You could also easily change the language of your
messages, though this package is not really intended as a substitute for
a dedicated module such as C<Locale::Maketext>.

Note that the methods generated are unique to each Text::Messages object,
so that given the definitions above, this statement:

  print $status_messages->file_open('my_file');

would end up calling the C<_default> message generator for the 
C<$status_messages> object. (C<file_open> was defined only in the constructor
for C<$error_messages>, so no C<file_open> method exists for
C<$status_messages>.) In effect, the method-call syntax is merely syntactic
sugar for a hypothetical method call like this:

  # there's not really a 'generate_message' method...
  print $status_messages->generate_message('file_open','my_file');

On a separate note, if you wish to subclass Text::Messages, you can override
the default (empty) C<_init> function that the constructor calls and perform
further initialization tasks there.

=head2 Performance Considerations

Not surprisingly, encapsulating your message generation within an object --
and, sometimes, an anonymous subroutine -- exacts a performance penalty. I've
found in small-scale experiments that the method call and anonymous-subroutine
execution is roughly an order of magnitude slower than using literal strings
and Perl's native interpolation. But it's still I<pretty> fast in most cases, 
and the reduced speed may be an acceptable tradeoff for improved
maintainability, particularly when it comes to things like error messages that
are (we hope!) generated only infrequently.

=head2 Potential Enhancements

There's currently no way to modify or add messages once you've constructed the
object, nor a clone/copy method, but I haven't yet found a reason to
implement either capability. And Simple Is Beautiful.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=over 4

=item Text::Messages->new(\%keyword_message_hash);

Construct a new Text::Messages object. The C<(key,value)> pairs in
C<%keyword_message_hash> are used to define the methods that the object will
expose and the messages that will be generated when those methods are called.
The keys should be names that would pass muster as Perl subroutine names, 
because you'll likely be calling them using the OO arrow syntax:

  $message_library->method_name;

The values (messages) may be either literal strings or blocks of code to be
interpreted each time the method is invoked. Parameters passed to the method
are accessible to the code block in C<@_> as if it were a normal subroutine.
For example:

  $status_message = Text::Messages->new(
    {general => sub{"You said: $_[0], $_[1], $_[2]."}};
  );
  print $status_message->general('zero', 'one', 'two');

results in:

  You said: zero, one, two.

The key C<_default> has a special significance: It defines a message that is
used if an unknown method is called. In this case, C<$_[0]> contains the name
of the unknown method, and the rest of C<@_> contains the parameters. The
object will provide baseline (one might say 'default') C<_default> behavior
if no such key is explicitly provided in the constructor.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, @args) = @_;
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;
  $self->_init(@args);  # do the real work
  return $self;
}


=item $messages->set_prefix($new_prefix)

Set the prefix that is prepended onto any message returned by this object. By
default, the prefix contains the name of the current executable (with path
stripped out if you're running under Windows and *nix OSs).

Omitting C<$new_prefix> is equivalent to specifying a null string.

=cut

sub set_prefix {
  croak "set_prefix expects a single optional param" unless @_ <= 2;
  my ($self, $prefix) = @_;
  $prefix = '' unless defined($prefix);
  $self->{prefix} = $prefix;
  return 1;
}


=item $messages->set_suffix($new_suffix)

Set the suffix that is appended onto any message returned by this object. By
default, the suffix is a single newline.

Omitting C<$new_suffix> is equivalent to specifying a null string.

=cut

sub set_suffix {
  croak "set_suffix expects a single optional param" unless @_ <= 2;
  my ($self, $suffix) = @_;
  $suffix = '' unless defined($suffix);
  $self->{suffix} = $suffix;
  return 1;
}


=item $messages->get_prefix

Return the currently defined prefix.

=cut

sub get_prefix {

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS (AND VARIABLES)

=over 4

=item AUTOLOAD

The AUTOLOAD method is called whenever a Text::Messages object receives a
method call to generate a message. It does not cache methods in the symbol
table for future access, because methods are unique to I<individual>
Text::Messages objects. (Remember that we're using method calls merely as
syntactic sugar to make the calling code more readable.)

  # figure out how we were called
  
  my $self = shift;
  $AUTOLOAD =~ /.*::(\w+)/;

  # look up the message for this method, or use the default message
  
  my $message_generator = $self->{messages}->{$message_name};
  if (!defined($message_generator)) {                        
    $message_generator = $self->{messages}->{_default};      
    @_ = ($message_name, @_);                                
  }

  # rule of thumb to figure out name of executable (sans path): eliminate
  # everything after the last slash (*nix) or backslash (Win)
