Text/Messages version 0.14
==========================

Text::Messages creates objects with methods you can call to generate both
static and dynamic status, error, or other messages. It's particularly useful
in larger projects, where it can be used to create centralized collections of 
messages that are easier to maintain and document than string literals
scattered throughout the code.

Full documentation is provided in the embedded POD.
